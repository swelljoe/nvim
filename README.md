# Joe's lightly modded ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

I forked the starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

I've just changed a few things I couldn't possibly live with (habits from
30 years of vim use that I couldn't handle changing).

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) for more.
